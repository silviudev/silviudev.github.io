			<h4>About Insane Space Rescue</h4>

			<p>
			Insane Space Rescue is a space invaders type game where the objective is to rescue colonists
			that are trapped in crates in outer space while fending off aliens. The catch is there is also 
			a larger alien ship that follows the player around and shoots and is invulnerable, and thus must be avoided. You have two guns, a main gun and a secondary gun fired with the mouse buttons.
			There is also a 2 player mode where a 2nd player can help out. The first player can continue if the second player dies
			but if the main player dies the game is over. The aliens get progressively faster and harder to dodge as time goes on.
			</p>

			<p>
			I wrote this project in Python using PyGame as a final project for a college game development class back in 2015. I found pyGame to be a good
			library and fun to work with. I took a template of a simple example game called Mail Pilot from the textbook where you have a plane and you collect clouds and turned it into this. I added the aliens, a shooting mechanic for players and the alien ship, the alien ship AI, new graphics, music and sounds, a difficulty mechanic that increases with time, and a two player mode. This was the first "real" and complete game I ever made.
