			<h3>About QuickBlog</h3>
	
			<p>Quickblog is a blogging app that lets you quickly sign up and start making blog posts. Users can register a new account, log in to an existing one, or visit an existing blog with or without being logged in. Once signed in users can quickly and easily create blog posts, as well as edit or delete their posts. Users can also comment on their own or any other blog without having to sign in.</p>
			
			<p>I wrote this app in Javascript using a Node.js backend with the Express.js framework for HTML templating. The app also uses MongoDB with the mongoose library to store user data. It also uses passport.js for managing sessions and user authentication. </p>
			
			<p>I used RESTful routing principles to create the different routes for the CRUD functionality. All the RESTful routes (index,new,create,edit,update,destroy) are present in the app. There are also routes for logging in and registering. </p>
			
			<p>For the front end I used bootstrap because it looks nice and is responsive by default. As a result all pages on the app look good on any screen size. There's also a nice bootstrap navbar at the top of every page. I also used a node package called connect-flash to flash error or success messages at the top of the screen whenever the user takes certain actions, like adding or deleting a post.</p>
