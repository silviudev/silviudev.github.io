			<h3>About React To-Do List</h3>

			<p>I created this project while learning React to help me learn it and also learn more about ES6. Making this project taught me quite a bit about ES6 classes and about converting old-style React component declarations into ES6 classes. (Many of the tutorials I looked at used the older "createClass" way of making components).</p>

			<p>This app uses React to allow the user to add, edit, and delete to-do list items. By default it contains 3 items to start. Each list item is a React component on its own, and all the list items are contained within a larger container component. The app is also responsive, and all the containers get wider as the screen becomes small in order to keep everything looking decent on small screens.</p>
