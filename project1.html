			<h4>About BrickBreaker</h4>

			<p>
			Brick breaker is a clone of the popular game Breakout, a game where you control a paddle and a bouncing ball
			to break bricks without letting the ball fall to the ground.
			</p>

			<p>
			This project started out with me following an MDN tutorial of how to make a basic breakout clone
			in Javascript found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript" target="new">here</a>. After completing it I added many features of my own, including a better UI, music with the ability 
			to toggle the sound on and off, pause button functionality, a star field animation that makes it look as
			though the player is flying through space, complete with a button to toggle this animation off (as it can get a bit distracting), and a function to randomly color the bricks each time you play instead of having them all one color. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Click the link below to open the game in a new tab and play in your browser! Use the up arrow to release the ball and the left and right arrows to move the paddle. The game has music and sounds playing right away (courtesy of Metaruka/maxstack at opengameart.org) so ensure your headphone volume isn't too high!
