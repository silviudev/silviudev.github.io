			<h3>About Responsive Image Gallery</h3>
	
			<p>I created this image gallery web page because I wanted to practice making a responsive page with modal functionality, and I wanted to see if I could do it without using jQuery or bootstrap or any other library.</p>
			
			<p>The page contains 9 images of photos, and at the largest screen size the layout is in 3 columns, at medium screen sizes it's two columns and at a small screen size the images are in only one column. The navbar at the top also adapts to the screen size, having smaller text on medium screens and becoming a one column menu on small screens.</p>
			
			<p>The page also has a modal functionality where you can click an image in the gallery and a modal will pop up near the top of the screen with a larger version of the image. This modal also is responsive and adjusts size with the screen. </p>

			<p>You can <a href="responsive_image_gallery/index.html" target="new">CLICK HERE</a> to view the page live right in your browser.</p>
