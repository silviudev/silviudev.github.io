			<h3>About Blackjack</h3>
	
			<p>Blackjack is a classic card game where the point is to obtain a hand worth 21 or less without going over 21.</p>
			
			<p>I wrote this game in Java using the JavaFX framework and also used an embedded SQLite database to keep track of high scores. The game is made up of multiple scenes, including the main menu scene, the main game scene, and the high scores scene. These scenes are contained within the main Stage, which in JavaFX is the main window of the application. The Stage switches between these scenes when certain buttons are pressed. </p>
			
			<p>For the main game, the player and the dealer are both represented by the Player class, which defines behavior such as what cards that person has in their hand, what the numeric value of their current hand is, and the player's money and bet amount. The cards themselves are represented by the Card class which defines the actual Image graphic of the card as well as its value and suit. Then there is a Deck class that initializes a deck of 52 Card objects that represent a standard deck. The Deck class also defines behaviors such as drawing a card or shuffling the deck.</p>
			
			<p>The main class is Blackjack.java. This class defines all of the UI elements for the game such as buttons and 
			labels as well as all variables needed for the game loop logic. This class makes heavy use of Java 8 lambda 
			expressions for event listeners to control user input. The main game loop runs once every 50 milliseconds, 
			which means 20 frames per second. Since the game doesn't contain many animations it doesn't need higher FPS so 
			running lower FPS saves some processing power.</p>
			
			<p>The game also connects to an embedded SQLite database using the SQLite JDBC library. It uses this database to allow the user to save their score and also to retrieve the top 10 high scores.</p>
